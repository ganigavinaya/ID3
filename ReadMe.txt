Required: python 3

Instructions to run:
python MLAssignment.py <L> <K> <training-set> <validation-set> <test-set> <to-print>
L: integer (used in the post-pruning algorithm)
K: integer (used in the post-pruning algorithm)
to-print:{yes,no}


Creates a output.txt file with following:

1. Entropy tree before pruning
2. Entropy tree after pruning
3. Accuracy of Entropy tree on testdata set before pruning
4. Accuracy of Entropy tree on testdata set after pruning
5. Variance impurity tree before pruning
6. Variance impurity tree after pruning
7. Accuracy of Variance impurity tree on testdata set before pruning
8. Accuracy of Variance impurity tree on testdata set after pruning
